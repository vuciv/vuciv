### 👨‍💻 About Me  

I’m a **Senior Software Engineer** at [**Taekus**](https://www.taekus.com), where I build end-to-end fintech infrastructure and lead development for our mobile app.  
My background spans full-stack development, product design, and human-computer interaction — all driven by a fascination with how humans and technology can collaborate creatively.

Before Taekus, I studied **Computer Science at the University of Chicago**, specializing in **Human-Computer Interaction**.  
My research on haptics in mixed reality, *Touch&Fold: A Foldable Haptic Actuator for Rendering Touch in Mixed Reality*, was published at **CHI ’21** and received an **Honorable Mention for Best Paper** (top 5% of submissions) — [read it here](https://doi.org/10.1145/3411764.3445099).
